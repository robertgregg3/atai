# Atainr Data Visualisation

This showcases some basic Data visualisation skills using D3 charting library. Created in 2021. Layout is a basic dashboard with navigation in the sidebar.

### Features include:

- Logging in / out flow with firebase for authentication
- Processing very complex data and displaying in several chart layouts
- The company I created this demo from were enabled to upload the csv file to then be processed. They were also allowed to download that csv and upload a new one. This has been disabled to put into my portfolio website but the functionality is still there.
- Download an image of the chart data in JPEG / PNG formats
- Mostly responsive. That wasn't a requirement but I have added some basic responsiveness.
